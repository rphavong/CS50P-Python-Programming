x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# # Boolean Question --> yes or no answer 
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")

# if x > y:
#      print("x is greater than y")

# if x == y:
#      print("x is equal to y")


# # How to do the above to be more effective using 'elif'
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")

# elif x > y:
#      print("x is greater than y")

# elif x == y:
#      print("x is equal to y")


# ## Even more effect using 'else'
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")

# elif x > y:
#      print("x is greater than y")

# else:
#      print("x is equal to y")


# ## Integrating the 'or' statement
# if x < y or x > y:
#     print("x is less than y")

# else:
#      print("x is equal to y")



# ## Using the not equal to '!=' statement
# if x != y:
#     print("x is not equal to y")

# else:
#      print("x is equal to y")


## Using the '==' 
if x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")

else:
     print("x is not equal to y")
